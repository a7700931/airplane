This bug-tracker is monitored by developers and other technical types.  We like detail!  So please use this form and tell us, concisely but precisely, what's up.  Please fill out ALL THE FIELDS!

If you have a feature request, please post to [the UserVoice](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/266908).

If this is a console issue (a problem with layout, rendering, colors, etc.), please post to the [console issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/console/issues).


**Important: When reporting BSODs or security issues, DO NOT attach memory dumps, logs, or traces to Github issues**.  Instead, send dumps/traces to secure@microsoft.com, referencing the GitHub bug number. Ideally, please [configure your machine to capture minidumps](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/315263/how-to-read-the-small-memory-dump-file-that-is-created-by-windows-if-a), repro the issue, and send the minidump from "C:\Windows\minidump\".

* Your Windows build number:  (Type `ver` at a Windows Command Prompt)

* What you're doing and what's happening:  (Copy&paste specific commands and their output, or include screen shots)

* What's wrong / what should be happening instead:

* Strace of the failing command, if applicable:  (If `some_command` is failing, then run `strace -o some_command.strace -f some_command some_args`, and link the contents of `some_command.strace` in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) here)
